# Multi-team communication protocol

A proposed protocol for communication among subteams of a mixed team.

This repository provides the protobuf definitions for multi team
communication for the 11 on 11 game technical challenge of the 
Small Size League at RoboCup 2015.

For system requirements and compilation instructions regarding
communication using protobufs, refer to the SSL radio protocol
